## Motivation

In progress.

## The problem

The statement of the problem is as follows.

**Problem.** Let $x \in (0,1)$ and $p\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $p>1$. Then the (finite) geometric sum

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \equiv \sum_{i=0}^p x^i = \frac{1-x^{p+1}}{1-x}\qquad (1)
\end{aligned}
$$

is strictly increasing and strictly convex in $x$.

*Solution 1*. We readily obtain that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}S &= 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots + px^{p-1}\\
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}S &= 2 + 6x + \cdots + p(p-1)x^{p-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

which are two polynomials of degree $p-1$ and $p-2$ whose coefficients are all positive, which together with $0<x<1$ implies that both equations are strictly positive. Duh, the end. $\square$

*Solution 2*. Let's focus our attention on the right-hand side expression of (1). Some tedious algebra allows us to obtain that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}S &= \frac{1-\left[1+p(1-x)\right]x^p}{(1-x)^2}\\
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}S &= \frac{2\left[1-(1-p)(1+p)x^p\right] - p(p+1)x^{p-1} - p(p+1)x^{p+1}}{(1-x)^3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Our goal is to show that the denominators of both expressions are positive.

**Claim 1.** For any $x\in (0,1)$ and $p\in \mathbb{N}$ with $p>2$, it is true that $1>\left[1+p(1-x)\right]x^p$.

*Proof*. By virtue of [Bernoulli's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_inequality), we find that

$$
(2-x^p) \geq 1 + p(1-x)
$$

Since $(1-x)^2 > 0$, it follows that $1 > x(2-x)$. Therefore $1>[x(2-x)]^p \geq [1+p(1-x)]x^p$, as desired. $\square$

This proves that $dS/dx>0$. Similarly, we argue that

**Claim 2.** The function $g(x) = 2\left[1-(1-p)(1+p)x^p\right] - p(p+1)x^{p-1} - p(p+1)x^{p+1}$ is strictly positive on $(0,1)$.

*Proof*. We readily deduce that

$$
\begin{aligned}
 g'(x) = -p(p-1)(p+1)x^{p-2}(x-1)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

which is guaranteed to be negative if the conditions on $x$ and $p$ hold. This result implies that $g$ is strictily decreasing on $(0,1)$. As $g(0) = 2$ and $g(1) = 0$, we immediately conclude that $g$ is strictly positive on $(0,1)$, as required. $\square$ 

While Solution 1 just relies on examining individual terms, our second approach proved substantially more tedious (yet fun).  This approach highlights the value of examining terms themselves, and not just the final summation (if it exists). Don't forget this rule of thumb: sometimes, a breakdown can lead to a breakthrough!
