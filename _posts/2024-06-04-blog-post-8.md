## Motivation

## The problem

The statement of the problem is as follows.

**Problem.** Let $x \in [0,1]$ and $p\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $p>1$. Then the (finite) geometric sum

$$
S \equiv \sum_{i=0}^p x^i = \frac{1-x^{p+1}}{1-x}
$$

is strictly increasing and strictly convex in $x$.

*Solution*. We readily obtain that

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{d}{dx}S = 
\end{gathered}
$$
