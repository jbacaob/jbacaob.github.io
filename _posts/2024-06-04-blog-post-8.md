## Motivation

In progress.

## The problem

The statement of the problem is as follows.

**Problem.** Let $x \in (0,1)$ and $p\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $p>1$. Then the (finite) geometric sum

$$
\begin{aligned}
S \equiv \sum_{i=0}^p x^i = \frac{1-x^{p+1}}{1-x}\qquad (1)
\end{aligned}
$$

is strictly increasing and strictly convex in $x$.

*Solution 1*. We readily obtain that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}S &= 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots + px^{p-1}\\
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}S &= 2 + 6x + \cdots + p(p-1)x^{p-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

which are two polynomials of degree $p-1$ and $p-2$ whose coefficients are all positive, which together with $0<x<1$ implies that both equations are strictily positive. Duh, the end. $\square$

*Solution 2*. Let's focus our attention on the right-hand side expression of (1). Some tedious algebra allows us to obtain that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}S &= \frac{1-\left[1+p(1-x)\right]x^p}{(1-x)^2}\\
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}S &= \frac{2\left[1-(1-p)(1+p)x^p\right] - p(p+1)x^{p-1} - p(p+1)x^{p+1}}{(1-x)^3}
\end{aligned}
$$

We now prove the following results.
