The Fibonacci sequence is ubiquitous in mathematics and nature. Sunflower seeds, pinecones, and even hurricanes resemble the Fibonacci pattern. The first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence $F$ are $$0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34$$. We can generate as many Fibonacci numbers as we want, since they nicely follow the following _recurrence_ relation,

\begin{equation*}
F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_i+1 = F_i + F_{i-1}
\end{equation*}
